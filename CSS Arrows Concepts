<div class="step-0">Imagine a box.</div>
<div class="step-1">The box has a border-top.</div>
<div class="step-2">It also has the other borders.</div>
<div class="step-5">Notice how the borders meet each other at angles.</div>
<div class="step-6">The background of the box is transparent.</div>
<div class="step-7">The box is actually zero width and zero height.</div>
<div class="step-8">Three of the borders are actually transparent in color.</div>
<div class="step-11">That's how a CSS triangle is made!</div>
